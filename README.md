# misc-fun-acts
Home of all the miscellaneous code I wrote meant for fun or just for fun.

## [btp_analysis](btp_analysis):
  * **What is it about:** It all started when I recieved my Mid-Term evaluation score sheet. Only scores and roll numbers were mentioned, no other details were disclosed due to *privacy_reasons*. But hang on, the other sheet for BTP allocation I got sometime ago had the other *private* details! A direct conflict! hence, I was bounded to solve it. So the code would now combine data from both the sheets on the basis of roll number.
  * **Some Fun Facts:**
    * The guides' names were visible on a simple `pdftotext` on the score sheet, lol!
    * For those who don't know, BTP stands for Bachelors Thesis Project.
