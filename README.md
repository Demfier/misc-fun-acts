# misc-fun-acts
Home to all the miscellaneous code I wrote meant for fun or just for fun.

## [btp_analysis](btp_analysis):
  * **What is it about:** It all started when I recieved my Mid-Term evaluation score sheet. Only scores and roll numbers were mentioned, no other details were disclosed due to *privacy_reasons*. But hang on, the other sheet for BTP allocation I got sometime ago had the other *private* details! A direct conflict! hence, I was bounded to solve it. So the code would now combine data from both the sheets on the basis of roll number.
  * **Some Fun and not-so-Fun Facts:**
    * The guides' names were visible on a simple `pdftotext` on the score sheet!
    * For those who don't know, BTP stands for Bachelors Thesis Project.
    * This act is just for Mechanical Department.

## [future_datathon](future_datathon):
  * **What is it about:** This was when the ultimate quest of placements was going on in my university. *Some* company (whose name I am not going to disclose) hosted an online challenge for full-time recruitment. I was sitting in my room, pondering over a possible solution for my thesis-project when a *certain* friend of mine (whose name I am not going to disclose) came rushing into my room and told me the entire story. As a friend, it was my duty to help him and so I grouped a bunch of people based on their Credit-Card transactions so that the Bank can suggest *suitable* schemes their customers.
  * **Some Fun and not-so-Fun Facts:**
    * I did not sit in the placements.
    * Eventually, it turned out that the ~~hackathon~~ datathon wasn't just for full-time recuritments. It was for interns too.
